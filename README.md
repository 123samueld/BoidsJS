# 🐦 BoidsJS

A JavaScript simulation inspired by **Craig Reynolds' Boids algorithm**, which models the collective behavior of flocking birds. This project visualizes simple rules that lead to emergent group motion — a classic example of artificial life and swarm intelligence.

## ✨ Features

- Pure JavaScript & HTML5 `<canvas>` implementation
- Real-time simulation of flocking behavior
- Lightweight and browser-based — no dependencies

## 📜 What Are Boids?

"Boids" is an artificial life program developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986. It simulates the flocking behavior of birds using three simple rules:

1. **Separation** – avoid crowding neighbors
2. **Alignment** – steer towards average heading of neighbors
3. **Cohesion** – move toward the average position of neighbors

From these rules, complex and natural-looking flocking behavior emerges.

## 🚀 Getting Started

No install required! Just follow these steps:

1. **Download** this repository as a ZIP:
   - Click the green **"Code"** button above, then **"Download ZIP"**
2. **Unzip** the folder to your computer
3. **Open** `index.html` in your preferred browser

The simulation will run automatically.

## 🛠️ Development Notes

- Customize visuals and logic in `index.js`
- Styling is handled in `index.css`
- The canvas is centered and styled with a metallic border to make it pop visually
